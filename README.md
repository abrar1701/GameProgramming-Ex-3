 These animations should be compatible with the new character mesh and have the same
 skeleton hierarchy.
* Open your project in Unreal Engine Editor.

 Blueprint is located. By default, it's usually located in the "Blueprints" folder.

 Blueprint."

 animation blueprint matching your new character's skeleton.

* Find the "Animation" section or graph, and add animation nodes for each animation you
 want to use.
